  <h1>A look at rapes on college campuses</h1>

  <p class="byline">By Angela DiMichele</p>

<p class="summary">Sexual assault on college campuses is an issue many men and women have experienced. Survivors often are too afraid to report the assault, but some have the courage to. The U.S. Department of Education's Campus Safety and Security data defines rape as the "penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus, with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim." Chart one, using the flagship university of each state, shows the number of rapes on college campuses around the country in 2017, which is the most recent data available. Chart two takes a closer look at one area: Florida. The bar graph shows how reported rapes on five campuses in Florida have chaged from 2015 to 2017.</p>
